Errors: Stats Unresponsive

I login to my account, click continue, then the site opens up. 
I see my cat, and the different activities around the cat. 
The cat is ALIVE, it is purring. I do my daily thing to check up on my cat. 
I look at my cat’s stats, and the hunger meter is at 30%, so I go to buy some cat food. 
I use my coins to purchase the food, I spend 10 cat coins, on 5 food. I click the buy button, 
and my coin count goes up by 10 and my cat food inventory goes up. I spam a couple more times, 
and I get more coins and cat food. I’m happy. Then I go feed my cat, I click the feed cat button. 
My cat food count is going down, but my cat’s hunger meter stays the same. I am very sad.
