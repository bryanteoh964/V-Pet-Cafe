Functions: Feed, Shower, Music

I login to my account, click continue, then the site opens up. I want to walk my cat, 
so I click walk and the cat starts eating. My cat is getting sick, so I stop trying to walk my cat. 
I want to calm my cat down with music, so I bring it to the music room. 
I play my cat’s favorite song, I load the music I want, and click the play button on the radio. 
The music doesn’t play. I’m upset now. I want to do something calming, so I take my cat to the shower room. 
I turn on the shower, but my cat starts eating. I am confused, I think my cat is broken.
