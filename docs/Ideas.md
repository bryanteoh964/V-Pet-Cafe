***List of Ideas:***

**Cat Cafe:** A website that plays music and displays [free] books/short stories that fits the mood of the song. Or better plays music based on the current text/section. This is while there are cats around the page (potentially interactable based on time we have). Can be built upon by analyzing user preferences and recommending literature based on music taste or vice versa (like and dislike feature essentially where the data is stored within the DB). We can probably find cat models and animations online. The model can also change based on the scenario. There are a lot of things that can be done but the bare skeleton site would be [free] text with music in the background and a cat theme.

*APIs:* Spotify, TheAudioDB, Shazam, Web Audio, GoogleBooks, Novel-Grabber,

Manga Eden (!?)

*Models:* Either self designed (pixel-art, 2-D vector-based, or Three.js) or obtained

from asset stores from Unity or itch.io.

**VPet:** A virtual pet simulator with a client-based storage system. There can be several different stats like hunger, happiness, and sleepiness. Features can be added like a shop or minigames as things progress. Looks to be quite difficult to implement in its entirety but this is an interesting/fun idea. The bare skeleton of this would be just one static pet (either 3-D or 2-D, probably 2-D for simplicity) and functionality to click to two-three locations and have a stat of the pet increase (think like a clicker game, the pet can remain stationary).

*APIs:* [same audio APIs as Cat Cafe], placekitten, PlaceDog, Baby Pig Pictures

*Models*: Same deal with Cat Cafe except the types of models are increased.

Another Idea: Public site accessibility and hours, whether a site is open or not

Note: OpenAI and other machine learning/AI things can always be added but definitely not a priority. Donâ€™t want us getting burnt out trying to implement too many things.

**QAT:** based on the previous two ideas this one is our simplest idea. Basically it consists of a web page with several categories you can click on (e.g. funny, optimistic, motivational, friendship, leadership, birthday, etc). In each category you will get a fun cat saying a certain quote and then the user can share this quote with friends.

APIs: Quote API, Cat picture API

***Database:*** We could use MongoDB and add it to the MERN stack or SQLite is also a possibility for low and simple data usage.

***Frontend:*** Most likely React but the type of React can differ. We can also try out other frameworks like **Vue** or Angular. NextJS is also pretty cool.

*Styling:* Basic CSS or we can borrow from libraries like Bootstrap or MaterialUI

***Backend:*** Express and Node is an option. We can also use other frameworks that use Python like Django or Flask.

***Stacks:*** MERN, MEAN, Django (can build both front and backend)

***OAUTH:*** probably via Google unless we want something else like Facebook

***Potential APIs:***

- Spotify
- TheAudioDB
- Shazam
- Web Audio
- GoogleBooks
- Manga Eden
- Novel-Grabber
- Google OAuth 2.0
- Youtube
- Discord (maybe interaction between Discord and the site?)
- Text-to-Speech (this could have comedic implications for our sites)
- Several image APIs (we can also static grab and store the images as a basis)
- Quote APIs

Note: we can always store some data in our DB and create our own API and endpoints.
