Memory: Lost Progress

I log into my account, click continue, then the site opens up. 
While its loading I think about how much fun I had with my cat yesterday, and 
how it was supposed to rain so I bought him a neon orange raincoat. 
Today it is also raining so I am going to put on the raincoat and complete the outfit with boots. 
Site loads and my cat is there very happy in the rain. I got to the cats closet (shop) and 
I see that the raincoat says buy when I already bought it yesterday. 
I am very mad because the cat is getting wet and I saved the money for weeks. 
The money is gone but no raincoat :(.
